EECS 398 Project
================

Clayton's official ruling ...
> Since dimensionality reduction is not a problem we have talked about in class, a good project could just focus on very fundamental issues, such as why is dimensionality reduction useful (e.g., irrelevant dimensions, curse of dimensionality). If you can just come up with some very basic demonstrations of when and where dimensionality reduction useful, on some real data with A couple of basic methods, I think that would be great.

### TL;DR
We're going to implement three dimensionality reduction algorithms. PCA, fastICA, and, if there's time, MIF. We'll motivate these methods by talking about the difficulties of working with high dimensional data and show examples of situations where DR is useful.

### TODO

* Short Term
    - Skeleton presentation
    - Implement PCA
* Long Term
    - Find data which demonstrates Curse of Dimensionality.
